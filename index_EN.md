## What Is Problem Solving

### The 5 Types of Problem Solving
**Assume all of the following as "problem solving."**

- Trouble 대응 type
    - A major issue that occurs unexpectedly
    - Examples: losing your credit card, getting injured in a traffic accident
    - Executing the solution is urgent
- Problem-solving type
    - Not urgent, but there is a gap between the ideal and reality
    - Examples: lately I can't fall asleep easily, "avoid rocking the boat" culture has spread through the organization and it's losing vitality
    - Tends to be left untouched, and the longer it's left, the harder it becomes to solve
- Potential Risk avoidance type
    - Prevent Trouble or Problem by addressing the seeds in advance
    - Examples: getting a full medical checkup, sleeping 7+ hours every day
    - Defensive problem solving
- Improvement Opportunity type
    - Problem solving that doesn't settle for the status quo and aims for better
    - Examples: training to beat your personal best in a marathon, improving your diet for health, improving routine work or meeting operations
    - Offensive problem solving
- Theme-answering type
    - Problem solving in the form of responding to a given proposition (including self Q&A)
    - Examples: partner: "What should we do for dinner tonight?", self Q&A: "Should my next PC be Windows or Mac?"
    - The theme may be vague, or it may require a meticulous answer
    - 🐰Says this occurs in all of types 1-4

### Everything in Work and Private Life Is Problem Solving
**Apply the five types above to every situation, both at work and in your private life.**

### What Good Problem Solving Looks Like
**At the individual level, aim for better; at the overall level, keep winning consistently; and to keep up with change, keep sharpening your problem solving skills.s**

- At the individual level, create the best possible solution
    - 🐰There is no absolute correct answer, so it's saying to look for something as good as possible
- At the overall level, rack up wins consistently
    - 🐰It's saying that to enrich both work and life, you want to win consistently, like a 7-3 record
- Keep responding to increasingly advanced problems
    - 🐰As life stages and the times change, problems become more complex, so you should keep honing problem solving to keep up

## Problem Solving Routine

### Overview
- A standard pattern for problem solving. You can also think of it as steps or a process
- Tools:
    - Sky, Rain, Umbrella
    - Decode, Ideate, Evaluate, Choose

### 🔨Sky, Rain, Umbrella
Template 1: Write after `:`

```markdown
- Sky (situation):
- Rain (interpretation):
- Umbrella (action):
```

Template 2: Delete what's in parentheses and write
```markdown
- (Sky:situation)
    - (Rain:interpretation)
        - (Umbrella:action)
```

Checklist:

```markdown
- Have you filled everything in, in the order Sky → Rain → Umbrella?
- Have you gathered enough information to state the Sky?
- Did you put your own interpretation into the Rain? You're not just parroting someone else, right?
- Is the Umbrella specific? Does it include 5W1H?
```

Variation trigger list:

```markdown
- Can you list multiple Skies?
- Can you derive multiple Rains from a given Sky?
- Can you derive multiple Umbrellas from a given Rain?
- Can you move back and forth between Sky/Rain/Umbrella for "procedure" and Sky/Rain/Umbrella for "meaning"?
    - Sky/Rain/Umbrella to think through the work procedure
    - Sky/Rain/Umbrella to think through the meaning of the work (intent and expected output)
```

Other trigger list:

```markdown
- Even if you came up with one Sky, there's "something else," right?
- Even if you came up with one Rain, there's "something else," right?
- Even if you came up with one Umbrella, there's "something else," right?

===

Example: There's a little snow on the ground and it's slippery, so I might not be able to walk to my usual set-meal place 15 minutes away

- There's a little snow on the ground and it's slippery
    - I should walk taking twice as long as usual
        - Let's set up a reminder so I leave early
        - Something else
    - Something else
- Something else

↓

- There's a little snow on the ground and it's slippery
    - I should walk taking twice as long as usual
        - Let's set up a reminder so I leave early
        - ★Let's call the owner to see how things are at the shop
    - ★I should pull out my snow boots from the closet
- ★There's a little snow, but it's not actually slippery (needs verification)
```

### 🔨Decode, Ideate, Evaluate, Choose
Explanation:

- Decode: Grasp the true nature of the problem you are facing, including understanding the essence hidden behind it
    - → n problems are defined
- Ideate: For the decoded problems, generate several solution options (choices) to solve them
    - → For each problem, n solutions are proposed
- Evaluate: Rank the generated solution options
    - → The relative merits of each solution are determined
- Choose: Pick the best option
    - → Choose (or have someone choose) a solution based on the ranking

Trigger list for when you're unsure whether to use Sky/Rain/Umbrella or Decode/Ideate/Evaluate/Choose:

```markdown
- If you integrate Sky and Rain, that becomes Decode
- If you split Umbrella into three parts, that becomes Ideate, Evaluate, Choose
- Decode, Ideate, Evaluate, Choose can handle more complex problems
```

Checklist to use while decoding

```markdown
- What are you decoding? Data? What people say? The phenomenon happening? All of it?
- Is the problem unclear? If so, are you decoding it on your own?
- Does the problem look clear? Even then, are you decoding it on your own?
- Did you try changing your perspective?
    - Did you look from a different position/role?
    - Did you try changing filters, such as applying/changing a framework or switching views?
    - Did you try using analogies or rephrasing?
- Did you try identifying the factors?
    - PST > Did you try logical factorization?
    - PST > Did you try making a factorization tree?
    - PST > Did you try making a logic tree?
- Did you try grouping-based inference?
    - Did you line up n problems, choose m among them, and consider the common meaning shared by the chosen m?
    - Did you think about other combinations as well?
```

Checklist to review when, during decoding, you feel like collecting more information

```markdown
- Are you keeping a mindset of creating the answer? You're not taking the easy way out by trying to "find" an answer, right?
- Aren't you collecting too much information? Experience says you can get by with less than what "information gatherers" think, you know?
```

Checklist to use while ideating

```markdown
- Do you have the intention to ideate from a zero base for the decoded problems?
- Bias > Aren't you trying to follow past successful experiences?
- Bias > Aren't you trying to rely on intuition?
- Bias > Isn't your ideation trapped in a narrow worldview? Aren't there solutions from a different dimension?
- Can each proposed solution be broken down into a gap-free structure with a logic tree?
- And can that tree break things down and list them out in this order: direction, specific measures, execution plan?
- When you go one level down in the tree, are you conscious of whether it's OR (any one is fine) or AND (must satisfy all)?
- Are you using OR? It's often used at the stage of considering directions. If you don't use it enough, you might miss better options
- Are you using AND? It's often used at the stage of considering concrete measures. If you don't use it enough, your solution will be incomplete
```

Checklist to use when creating evaluation criteria (during evaluation)

```markdown
- Are you looking at both easy-to-see and hard-to-see criteria? (easy to see | hard to see)
    - Sales, profit | customer satisfaction, compliance
    - Reduction, savings | employee burnout level, morale, service attractiveness, investment
    - Profitability | social impact, competitive advantage
    - Quantitative | Qualitative
    - Cost | performance
    - Benefit | risk
    - Pros | cons
    - Hard | soft
- Are your criteria at consistent layers, and is it easy to check for gaps/omissions?
    - You're not expressing things vaguely in sentences, right?
    - You're not trying to visually disguise ambiguity with a table, right?
    - It's logically broken down, right?
```

Selection list to use when deciding the standard for ranking (during evaluation)

```
Please choose one.

- Does it seem good to use the current state as the baseline (zero)?
- Does it seem good to use one of the options as the baseline?
- Does it seem good to use the target direction as the baseline and see whether each option aligns with it?
```

Trigger list to increase objectivity and specificity of scoring methods (during evaluation)

```
- If the baseline is zero, how about using plus/minus signs?
    - How about a 5-level scale of ++, +, 0, -, --? Isn't it easier than numbers or ⭕❌ to see how high/low it is relative to the baseline?
    - Can you define the difference between each level, such as the difference between ++ and +?
```

Method list for conducting a comprehensive evaluation with high objectivity (during evaluation)

```
- How about the simple sum method?
    - 1: Add up the scores for each evaluation criterion for each option to get a total score
    - 2: Adopt the option with the highest total score
    - But differences between numbers across criteria don't carry much meaning, right? Are you sure this method is OK? Why?
- Weighted sum method
    - 1: Same as the simple sum method, but assign weights to important criteria
    - Why did you assign that weight to that criterion? Have you discussed it and feel convinced?
    - Since it's basically the same as the simple sum method, it's probably difficult. Are you sure this method is OK? Why?
- Constraint method
    - 1: Create selection constraints (whether a criterion satisfies a condition)
    - 2: Create n constraints and order them from the ones you want to apply first
    - 3: For each option, run through how far it satisfies the constraints
    - 4: Adopt the option that clears the most constraints
    - This often has the highest objectivity and acceptability among these methods. Does this method seem OK?
- Two-stage evaluation method
    - 1: First, screen out options using the simple sum method
    - 2: Next, evaluate the remaining options using the constraint method
    - This may be handy when there are many options. Does this method seem OK?
- Logical matrix evaluation method
    - 1: Choose two criteria and create a logical matrix (vertical axis: criterion 1, horizontal axis: criterion 2)
    - 2: Do the same to create another matrix. That is, you should be able to make 2 matrices using 4 criteria
    - 3: For each logical matrix, plot each option
    - 4: After plotting, create a matrix for overall evaluation and plot there as well
    - If the evaluation axes are logical, it tends to lead to more objective evaluations. Does this method seem OK?
```

Logical matrix template:

| Perspective 1 \ Perspective 2 | **Low** | **Medium** | **High** |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | 
| **High** |   M    |   H    |   H    |
| **Medium** |   L    |   M    |   H    |
| **Low** |   L    |   L    |   M    |

```
| Perspective 1 \ Perspective 2 | **Low** | **Medium** | **High** |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | 
| **High** |   M    |   H    |   H    |
| **Medium** |   L    |   M    |   H    |
| **Low** |   L    |   L    |   M    |
```

How to operate the logical matrix:

- Create matrix 1 and matrix 2
- For matrix 1 and matrix 2, plot each option on each
- Create an overall evaluation matrix
- Plot each option on the overall evaluation matrix
    - Decide the vertical axis based on the plot in matrix 1
    - Decide the horizontal axis based on the plot in matrix 2

List to read in advance to prepare for unfairness when you ask someone else to choose:

```
- If you are not the decision maker, you are not the one who chooses among the evaluated options
- The other party has their own decision-making style
    - Even in the same case, some people take risks and others don't
    - Even the same person may take risks in some cases and not in others
    - Decisions are heavily influenced by each individual's values
- Whether it's an individual or a company, the people inside are individuals, and decisions are always made by individuals
- If you want the other party to choose an option, they won't accept it just because you argue what they "should" do
- After the other party doesn't choose your option, complaining won't help
    - You should prepare for the other party's decision-making style
- If you can empathize with the other party's position and feelings, the chance they'll choose your option may increase
    - It may sound stupid, but the other party is human too. It can't hurt to do it
```

## Problem Solving Tools

### Overview
Logical tools you can use in the Decode, Ideate, and Evaluate steps.

### 🔨1: MECE
- Can be used in Decode and Ideate
- No overlap AND no omissions

### 🔨2: Polar-opposite options
- Can be used in Ideate
- For a given option (solution), propose its polar opposite

Examples:

- Proactive → Reactive
- User perspective → Provider perspective
- Increase quantity → Improve quality

### 🔨3: Paired concepts
- Can be used in Evaluate
- List a perspective together with its paired counterpart

Examples:

- Quantitative | Qualitative
- Cost | performance
- Short term | long term

### 🔨4: Logical factorization
- Can be used in Decode and Ideate
- Factorize a problem like an equation
- Makes it easier to discuss quantitatively, such as which factor to increase/decrease and by how much

Examples:

- `Profit = (Price - Cost) * Volume`
    - To increase profit? → You can discuss raising price, lowering cost, increasing volume, etc.
- `Share = Market coverage * Win rate in covered markets`
    - To raise share by 6%? → You can propose variations and discuss how to adjust coverage and win rate to achieve it

### 🔨5: Frameworks
- Can be used in Decode and Ideate
- A thinking framework for grasping the whole picture of what you're examining
- There are many; use as appropriate
- Practically speaking, you can treat it as having no omissions

Example: McKinsey's 7S framework for organizations

- 🐰Too much trouble to summarize, so omitted: [McKinsey's organizational change framework "7S" - Salesforce Blog](https://www.salesforce.com/jp/blog/7s-for-change-organization/)

### 🔨6: That and everything else
- Can be used in Decode, Ideate, and Evaluate
- Tools 1-5 strengthen non-omission, but sometimes they don't fit well → that's where this 6 comes in

🐰See the "Other trigger list" under Sky, Rain, Umbrella
